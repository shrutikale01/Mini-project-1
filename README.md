# Mini Project on Descriptive Analytics using file handling 

1. **Descriptive Analysis**

`Analyze the distribution of movie ratings. What percentage of movies have high (5), medium (3-4), and low (1-2) ratings?`

`Identify the top 10 most-rated movies`


2. **Genre Insights**

`Which movie genres are the most frequently rated?`

`Compare the average ratings across different genres. Are certain genres consistently rated higher or lower?`

3. **User Engagement Analysis**

`Identify the most active users (profession) based on the number of ratings theyâ€™ve given.`

`Analyze the relationship between user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation) and their movie preferences or rating patterns.`


4. **Rating Distribution by Demographics**

`Investigate how ratings vary by user demographic attributes (age, gender, occupation).`

`Are there specific genres preferred by certain age groups or occupations?`


5. **Top Performers**

`Identify the movies with the highest average ratings (considering a minimum number of ratings for fairness).`

`Analyze the characteristics of top-rated movies (e.g., release year, genres).`


6. **Exploring Long Tail**

`Investigate the "long tail" of the dataset: How many movies receive very few ratings?`

`What are the characteristics of these less-rated movies compared to popular ones?`


7. **Tag Analysis**

`Analyze the tags associated with movies. What are the most frequently used tags?`

`Are tags consistent with movie genres?`
 

8. **Visualization Projects**

`Create dashboards to visualize:`

`The distribution of ratings by genres and years.`

`Popular genres by user demographics.`

`Heatmaps showing the correlation between genres, user activity, and ratings`
